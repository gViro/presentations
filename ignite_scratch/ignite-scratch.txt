  @alandd: My 12-year-old son created a few more animations on his own and showed it off to his best friend.
  Angelina B.'s blog: "Over the summer I took a programming class that my Dad [Mike] was teaching.  It was called Gangplank Jr. and he taught us Scratch.  You can see my Gangplank Jr Aquarium program that I made here [http://is.gd/4eI0N]." (Pic in projects folder)
  @refriedchicken: Not so much about attendees but I did just do one at ANLC and they are integrating Gangplank Jr/Scratch into their computer labs this year.
