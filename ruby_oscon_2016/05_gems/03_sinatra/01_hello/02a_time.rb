# Using the "get" method, set up a Sinatra route for
# HTTP GET requests for the "/time" path. Use
# Time.now.to_s to respond with the current time.

# When you're done, save your work, run your script,
# and open http://localhost:4567/time in your browser.
# Refresh to see the time change.

# Press Ctrl-C in your terminal when you're ready to
# shut the server down.
