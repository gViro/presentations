require "yaml"

# Create a class with attributes of your choosing.
# Example:
class Song
  attr_accessor :title, :artist
end

# Create an instance of your class and assign
# values to your attributes. Example:
song = Song.new
song.title = "I Am the Highway"
song.artist = "Audioslave"

# Finally, pass your instance to the YAML.dump
# method, and print the result with "puts".
